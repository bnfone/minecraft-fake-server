# Demo Server
This is a software used to emulate a Minecraft server for status/query only. This is not a playable server, and you will be disconnected if you attempt to connect. This software is meant to showcase the available features of mcstatus.io, a status retrieval site. This software can simulate a real server, running a Java Edition and Bedrock Edition status, as well as full query support.
